# The-Asteroid-Game
 Final Repository I'm making for The Asteroids Game. Based on the Atari Asteroids game. Important to note that it is "based". Mainly is a learning project.

 This is the final version so far. This game took me around 12 days to make. Unfortunately, the game over screen doesn't trigger anymore because I lost some of my code and I can't debug the issues. This project was made in Unity to learn the basics of the engine.
